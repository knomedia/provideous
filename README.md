# Provideous

Provideous is a command line application that will quickly create a one off video page. I use it to quick create a page that I can drop on the web (or drop box for that matter) to share quick screen casts I've made with other remote team members. By default it uses [`videously`](https://github.com/knomedia/videously) to compress and normalize the video.

## Installation

Install it with:

    $ gem install provideous

## Usage

Videously is just getting under way, for the latest instructions, check the `development` branch
